# Humble Scheme

A small and loving counterpoint to the concept of The Grand Scheme of Things, this organization is lead by:
- A desire to do good in the world by being good to the people around us every day
- Joy in the small things, like a cup of tea or moments with friends or fresh flowers or a smile from a stranger
- Belief in the power of community and connection, directly to people, with care and kindness
- Delight in building and making things - from software to crafts to homes, we find joy in all the humble making

In a landscape driven by hustle and productivity and the desire to be the next Unicorn, we instead commit ourselves to the humble work of putting pebbles on piles...the only humane and joyful way we know to build mountains.
